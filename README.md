**Overview:**
The purpose of this challenge was to use Jupyter Notebook and open APIs to source data. Using the API keys, I was able to source specific data such as Movie Reviews to create a list then use that list to manipulate or extra specific data. This has been the toughest challenge so far. 

**Functionality:**
    1. Import and setup libraries
    2. Create gitignore and .env files
    3. Fetching data from NYT API and storing in a list
    4. Print results 
    5. Create dataframe to store results
    6. Manipulate the data to perfrom specific tasks to show understanding
    7. Do the same steps above for the TMDB API
    8. Merge both DataFrames on the Title column
    9. Remove duplicates
    10. Save the results into a .csv file
**Summary:** 
During this challenge I have learned how to analyze diverse datasets using APIs. This has been the toughest challenge so far but am glad that I was able to push through with help from classmates and instructors.
